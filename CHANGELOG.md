## v0.1.47 — disable auto-reconnect polling

Disable the WebSocket auto-reconnect loop per Ethan voice 3630 — the 60s
retry (v0.1.45) and the legacy exponential-backoff fallback were both
generating constant network traffic against `api.restream.io` that Ethan
suspected was clogging his Wi-Fi / ISP.

- On any disconnect, the WS client now flips state to `disconnected` and
  stays there. No retry timer is scheduled.
- The manual **Reconnect** toolbar button still works — it goes through
  `performFullReconnect()` → `chat.reconnect()` and bypasses the
  auto-retry path entirely.
- Other polling is unchanged:
  - GitHub update poller stays on its 1-hour cadence (not the culprit).
  - WebSocket heartbeat ping stays on 30s (intrinsic to the WS protocol).
  - Periodic chat-context REST refresh stays on 10 minutes (low frequency).
- Test-only escape hatch: `client.setAutoReconnectEnabled(true)` restores
  the v0.1.45 polling behaviour. Production default is `false`.

## v0.1.46 — connection-status flicker fix

Coalesce sub-750ms connection-status dips so the channels panel stops
flashing during Restream's boot-storm of `connected → connecting →
connected` cycles.

## v0.1.45 — unified auto-reconnect (superseded by v0.1.47)

Auto-reconnect was rewritten to use the same OAuth-refresh + reconnect
flow as the manual button, on a 60s cadence. Subsequently disabled by
default in v0.1.47 due to network-traffic concerns.
