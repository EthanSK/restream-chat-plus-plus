 *                              chat-session cookies yet. The user needs to
 *                              open the Compose window once so Restream
 *                              provisions the `.restream.io` cookies +
 *                              `accessXsrfToken`. We auto-attempt provision
 *                              via an invisible Compose window first; this
 *                              reason is reported only if that fails too.
 *  - `no-active-connections` — channels panel is empty (nothing to reply to).
 *  - `no-show-id`            — Restream's `/client/reply` returned HTTP 404
 *                              AND we had no showId to send. In v0.1.17–
 *                              v0.1.19 this was a pre-flight gate; v0.1.20
 *                              flipped it to a post-attempt failure mode
 *                              so users CAN send before the first WS event
 *                              flows (Restream's backend can sometimes
 *                              resolve the show implicitly from session
 *                              cookies + the user's only active show).
 *                              When this comes back the most likely cause
 *                              is no active stream / no in-progress event.
 *  - `send-failed`           — POST /client/reply returned non-2xx.
 *  - `error`                 — unexpected (network / JS) failure.
